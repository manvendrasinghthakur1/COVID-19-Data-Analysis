# COVID-19-Data-Analysis
The COVID-19 SQL Data Exploration project focuses on leveraging SQL (Structured Query Language) to explore and analyze COVID-19-related data. SQL, a powerful language for managing and querying relational databases, provides an efficient and structured approach to extract insights from large datasets.

The project begins by identifying and obtaining relevant COVID-19 data from reliable sources, such as governmental health agencies, research institutions, or public health databases. This data may include information about infection rates, testing data, vaccination records, hospitalizations, and other pertinent variables.

Once the data is acquired, it is loaded into a relational database management system (RDBMS) capable of executing SQL queries. The RDBMS organizes the data into tables, allowing for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation.

The exploration phase involves formulating SQL queries to investigate different aspects of the COVID-19 data. These queries can encompass a wide range of analysis, including:

Descriptive Statistics: Calculating summary statistics, such as total cases, average daily infections, or mortality rates, to gain an overview of the data.

Filtering and Sorting: Selecting specific subsets of data based on conditions or criteria, such as filtering data by date, location, age group, or other relevant variables.

Aggregation and Grouping: Summarizing data by aggregating values and grouping them based on specific attributes. For example, calculating total cases per country or daily new infections by age group.

Joining and Combining Tables: Combining multiple tables to analyze relationships and associations between different datasets. This can involve joining COVID-19 data with demographic data or hospital capacity data to assess the impact on specific populations or healthcare systems.
